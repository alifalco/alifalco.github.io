            <p>This is the third link I made using HTML coding.  This is all about me!  My name is Ali, and I'm a freshman at The University of Rhode Island.  I am learning to program in this class called The Joy of Programming.  It is very interesting to me and I am thinking about studying computer science because I am enjoying coding so much.  I believe it is definitely a skill we should all have!</p>
